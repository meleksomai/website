# Melek Somai Personal Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal website [somai.me](https://somai.me)! I created this site to serve as a portfolio showcasing my projects, research publications, and experiences. It is also a playground to learn about web frameworks like [next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and other web tools.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/) with App Router: One of the most popular React frameworks.
- [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/): A zero-runtime stylesheets in Typescript. It is compatible with React Server Components (RSC) and it replaces [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) my previous choice of CSS-in-JSS.
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) and Prettier: For clean, consistent, and error-free code.
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/): It is one of the most beautiful headless UI components library.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/): Fast, disk space efficient package manager.
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/): Incremental bundler and build system optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust.
- [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/): Powerful, flexible, Markdown-based authoring framework open sourced by Stripe team.
- [What I listed to in Spotify](): Inspired by and copied from [leerob.io](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io).
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): For hosting and deployment.
- [Citation JS](https://citation.js.org/): a format-independent, modular bibliography tool to manage my academic publications.
