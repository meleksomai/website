            To make a reservation at either hotel, we kindly ask that you
            contact them directly and specify that you are attending the wedding
            of Melek Somai and Imen Ben Abid. When making your reservation,
            please reference the pricing that we have arranged for our guests.
            We also suggest that you cc me on your reservation request so that I
            can assist you if needed and make sure that everything is in order.
            We encourage you to make your reservation as soon as possible to
            ensure availability and to take advantage of the special rates we
