excerpt: This quality improvement study of 137 846 video visits showed an overall 90% success rate. Patient rather than clinician factors were more systematically associated with successful completion of video visits, and clinician comfort with technology was associated with successful video visits or conversion to telephone visits. The findings suggest that, as policy makers consider expanding telehealth coverage and hospital systems focus on investments, consideration of patient support, equity, and friction should be kept in the forefront.
