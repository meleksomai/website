I joined Inception Health back in 2019 to combine my interest in Medicine, Clinical Computing, and Engineering, to develop new patient-centric platform. Since then, we grew our product & engineering team, and have developed the digital infrastructure that is delivering today the digital care experience for Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin.
