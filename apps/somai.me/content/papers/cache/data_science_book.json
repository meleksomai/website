It focuses on digital disease surveillance through the application of machine learning to non-traditional data sources. Developing countries are uniquely prone to large-scale emerging infectious disease outbreaks due to disruption of ecosystems, civil unrest, and poor healthcare infrastructure – and without comprehensive surveillance, delays in outbreak identification, resource deployment, and case management can be catastrophic. In combination with context-informed analytics, students will learn how non-traditional digital disease data sources – including news media, social media, Google Trends, and Google Street View – can fill critical knowledge gaps and help inform on-the-ground decision-making when formal surveillance systems are insufficient."},"content":"","citation":{"publisher":"Springer International Publishing","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-47994-7","type":"book","source":"Crossref","title":"Leveraging Data Science for Global Health","language":"en","editor":[{"given":"Leo Anthony","family":"Celi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Maimuna S.","family":"Majumder","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Patricia","family":"Ordóñez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Juan Sebastian","family":"Osorio","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kenneth E.","family":"Paik","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Melek","family":"Somai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"ISBN":"9783030479930","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-47994-7","id":"temp_id_1812225632993656"},"publishedAt":{"text":"January 1, 2020","iso":"2020-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","timestamp":1577854800000,"relative":"5 years ago"},"publisher":"Springer International Publishing","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-47994-7"}
