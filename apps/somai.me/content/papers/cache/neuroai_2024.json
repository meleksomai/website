The trend of using AI-based clinical research in different fields of medicine and defining the shortcomings of those trials will guide researchers and future studies.\n\n## Methods\nWe systematically reviewed trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov that apply AI in clinical research. We explored the trend of AI-applied clinical research and described the design and conduct of such trials. Also, we considered high-quality trials to represent their enrollees’ and other characteristics.\n\n## Results\nOur search yielded 839 trials involving a direct application of AI, among which 330 (39.3 %) trials were interventional, and the rest were observational (60.7 %). Most of the studies aimed to improve diagnosis (70.2 %); in less than a quarter of trials, management was targeted (22.8 %), and AI was implemented in an acute setting (13 %). Gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurology were the significant fields of medicine with the application of AI in their research. High-quality published AI trials showed good generalizability in terms of their enrollees’ characteristics, with an average age of 52.46 years old and 50.28 % female participants.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe incorporation of AI in different fields of medicine needs to be more balanced, and attempts should be made to broaden the spectrum of AI-based clinical research and to improve its deployment in real-world practice.","citation":{"publisher":"Elsevier BV","DOI":"10.1016/j.ibmed.2024.100179","type":"article-journal","page":"100179","source":"Crossref","title":"The trend of artificial intelligence application in medicine and neurology; the state-of-the-art systematic scoping review 2010–2022","volume":"10","author":[{"ORCID":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5812-2359","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mohammad Hossein","family":"Abbasi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Melek","family":"Somai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hamidreza","family":"Saber","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"container-title":"Intelligence-Based Medicine","language":"en","issued":{"date-parts":[[2024]]},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmed.2024.100179","ISSN":"2666-5212","container-title-short":"Intelligence-Based Medicine","id":"temp_id_6243019883447931"},"publishedAt":{"text":"January 1, 2024","iso":"2024-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","timestamp":1704085200000,"relative":"a year ago"},"publisher":"Intelligence-Based Medicine","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmed.2024.100179"}
