Telephonic care coordination is standard care, but labor intensive. We implemented a patient postdischarge digital engagement (PDDE) program to scale coordination. We hypothesized that PDDE could reduce readmissions for low-risk patients and supplement care coordination for medium- and high-risk patients. \n\n## STUDY DESIGN: \nPragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomization trial with 5 implementation waves based upon primary care clinic region. \n\n## METHODS: \nAll inpatient hospital discharges between March 2020 and November 2020 were stratified by readmission risk. Low-risk patients were offered access to PDDE, and moderate-risk and high-risk patients were offered access to PDDE and care coordination. Readmission was defined as an unplanned inpatient admission within 30 days from discharge. An intention-to-treat primary analysis was conducted using mixed-effects logistic regression clustering for wave; a treatment-on-the-treated analysis was also conducted to assess the impact among program users. \n\n## RESULTS: \nA total of 5490 patient discharges were examined (2735 control; 2755 intervention); 1949 patients were high risk, 2032 were medium risk, and 1509 were low risk. PDDE intervention did not significantly affect readmission among low-risk (95% CI, -0.23 to 0.90; P = .23), medium-risk (95% CI, -0.14 to 0.60; P = .21), and high-risk (95% CI, -0.32 to 0.64; P = .48) groups after adjustment for time and patient factors. In a treatment-on-the-treated analysis, among patients who activated the PDDE program, readmission was also similar among the low-, medium-, and high-risk cohorts. \n\n## CONCLUSIONS: \nOur study expanded resource-limited care coordination by offering low-risk patients a service they were unable to receive previously while having no impact on readmission. PDDE efficiently provided additional touch points between patients and providers.","citation":{"publisher":"Clinical Care Targeted Communications Group, LLC","issue":"2","DOI":"10.37765/ajmc.2024.89498","type":"article-journal","page":"e32-e38","source":"Crossref","title":"Scaling Care Coordination Through Digital Engagement: Stepped-Wedge Trial Assessing Readmissions","volume":"30","container-title":"The American Journal of Managed Care","language":"en","issued":{"date-parts":[[2024,2,14]]},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37765/ajmc.2024.89498","ISSN":"1936-2692","container-title-short":"Am J Manag Care","id":"temp_id_01439852601410041"},"publishedAt":{"text":"February 14, 2024","iso":"2024-02-14T05:00:00.000Z","timestamp":1707886800000,"relative":"10 months ago"},"publisher":"The American Journal of Managed Care","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37765/ajmc.2024.89498"}
