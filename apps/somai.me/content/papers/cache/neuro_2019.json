Acute stroke was the most studied conditions (68, 33%), followed by aneurysms (63, 31%), carotid stenosis (48, 24%), intracranial atherosclerotic disease (7, 3.5%), cerebral venous thrombosis (6, 3%), arteriovenous malformation (4, 2%), idiopathic intracranial hypertension (3, 1.5%), and others (6, 3%). Overall, 59 (29%) trials were completed, 79 (37%) were active trials (28% recruiting), and 22 (11%) were terminated or suspended. Academic centers and industry were the most common primary funding source (63% and 29%, respectively), with no funding source reported in 16 (7.7%) trials. Among 77 completed or terminated trials, only 9 (11.7%) trials reported findings within 12 months. Median time to publication for trials funded by academia was 1.66 years (interquartile range (IQR) 0.7–2.1) versus 2.1 years (IQR 1.2–3.25) for industry-funded studies.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>A low dissemination rate for results and a high rate of study non-completion, as well as lack of geographic dispersion of trials appear to be major challenges in the field.</jats:p></jats:sec>","DOI":"10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-015117","type":"article-journal","page":"1277-1282","source":"Crossref","title":"Clinical trials of neurointervention : 2007–2018","volume":"11","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7590-2023","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hamidreza","family":"Saber","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9454-0678","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ashutosh P","family":"Jadhav","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gary B","family":"Rajah","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sandra","family":"Narayanan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sunil A","family":"Sheth","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"David S","family":"Liebeskind","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Melek","family":"Somai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"container-title":"Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery","language":"en","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,17]]},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-015117","ISSN":"1759-8478","container-title-short":"J NeuroIntervent Surg","id":"temp_id_12082640310228498"},"publishedAt":{"text":"September 17, 2019","iso":"2019-09-16T23:00:00.000Z","timestamp":1568674800000,"relative":"3 years ago"},"publisher":"Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-015117"}
