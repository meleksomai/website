We found evidence of a total reduction in costs, both for the patients (US $76·36 per patient) and the healthcare system by decreasing referrals to tertiary-care centres by 75% in the intervention group. This study also shows a significant reduction in the time to receive dermatological care; the patients in the intervention group saved a total of 19 892 km and 269 h of travel when compared with patients in the control group. Finally, healthcare delivery was likely improved as GPs in the intervention group were supported by a specialist consultant for all patients who needed dermatological care and thus did not need to refer them as often. Patients in the intervention group were also given a significantly wider variety of diagnoses and treatments than those in the control group (P =0·03), and we think this could indirectly be a marker of better healthcare delivery."},"content":"","citation":{"publisher":"Oxford University Press (OUP)","issue":"1","DOI":"10.1111/bjd.13607","type":"article-journal","page":"265-267","source":"Crossref","title":"Mobile teledermatology for a prompter and more efficient dermatological care in rural Mongolia","volume":"173","author":[{"given":"K.","family":"Byamba","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences; Ulaanbaatar Mongolia"}]},{"given":"S.","family":"Syed-Abdul","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Informatics; College of Medical Science and Technology; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Taiwan"}]},{"given":"M.","family":"García-Romero","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Cambridge MA U.S.A"}]},{"given":"C.-W.","family":"Huang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Informatics; College of Medical Science and Technology; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Taiwan"}]},{"given":"S.","family":"Nergyi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Dermatology Center of Mongolia; Ulaanbaatar Mongolia"}]},{"given":"A.","family":"Nyamdorj","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Allergymed Hospital; Ulaanbaatar Mongolia"}]},{"given":"P.-A.","family":"Nguyen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Informatics; College of Medical Science and Technology; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Taiwan"}]},{"given":"U.","family":"Iqbal","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Informatics; College of Medical Science and Technology; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Taiwan"}]},{"given":"K.","family":"Paik","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Cambridge MA U.S.A"}]},{"given":"l.","family":"Celi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Cambridge MA U.S.A"}]},{"given":"V.","family":"Nikore","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Cambridge MA U.S.A"}]},{"given":"M.","family":"Somai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Clinical Informatics; Harvard Medical School; Boston MA U.S.A"}]},{"given":"W.-S.","family":"Jian","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Health Care Administration; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Taiwan"}]},{"given":"Y.-C.","family":"Li","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Informatics; College of Medical Science and Technology; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Taiwan"},{"name":"Department of Dermatology; Wan Fang Hospital; Taipei Taiwan"}]}],"container-title":"British Journal of Dermatology","language":"en","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,12]]},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.13607","ISSN":"0007-0963","container-title-short":"Br J Dermatol","id":"temp_id_7859857417899017"},"publishedAt":{"text":"May 12, 2015","iso":"2015-05-11T23:00:00.000Z","timestamp":1431385200000,"relative":"8 years ago"},"publisher":"British Journal of Dermatology","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.13607"}
