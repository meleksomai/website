excerpt: Through this study we were able to quantify some of the most important benefits of teledermatology. We found evidence of a total reduction in costs, both for the patients (US $76·36 per patient) and the healthcare system by decreasing referrals to tertiary-care centres by 75% in the intervention group. This study also shows a significant reduction in the time to receive dermatological care; the patients in the intervention group saved a total of 19 892 km and 269 h of travel when compared with patients in the control group. Finally, healthcare delivery was likely improved as GPs in the intervention group were supported by a specialist consultant for all patients who needed dermatological care and thus did not need to refer them as often. Patients in the intervention group were also given a significantly wider variety of diagnoses and treatments than those in the control group (P =0·03), and we think this could indirectly be a marker of better healthcare delivery.
