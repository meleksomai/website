excerpt: Explore the transformative role of AI in clinical research, with a focus on neurointervention, balanced applications, and real-world integration.

## Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an increasingly popular research focus for multiple areas of science. The trend of using AI-based clinical research in different fields of medicine and defining the shortcomings of those trials will guide researchers and future studies.

## Methods
We systematically reviewed trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov that apply AI in clinical research. We explored the trend of AI-applied clinical research and described the design and conduct of such trials. Also, we considered high-quality trials to represent their enrollees’ and other characteristics.

## Results
Our search yielded 839 trials involving a direct application of AI, among which 330 (39.3 %) trials were interventional, and the rest were observational (60.7 %). Most of the studies aimed to improve diagnosis (70.2 %); in less than a quarter of trials, management was targeted (22.8 %), and AI was implemented in an acute setting (13 %). Gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurology were the significant fields of medicine with the application of AI in their research. High-quality published AI trials showed good generalizability in terms of their enrollees’ characteristics, with an average age of 52.46 years old and 50.28 % female participants.

## Conclusion
The incorporation of AI in different fields of medicine needs to be more balanced, and attempts should be made to broaden the spectrum of AI-based clinical research and to improve its deployment in real-world practice.
